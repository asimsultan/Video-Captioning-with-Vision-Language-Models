# Video Captioning with Vision-Language Models

Welcome to the Video Captioning with Vision-Language Models project! This project focuses on generating captions for videos using vision-language models.

## Introduction

Video captioning involves generating descriptive captions for video content. In this project, we leverage the power of Vision-Language Models to perform video captioning using a dataset of videos and their corresponding captions.

## Dataset

For this project, we will use a custom dataset of videos and their captions. You can create your own dataset and place it in the `data/video_captioning_data.csv` file.

## Project Overview

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Datasets
- Pandas
- OpenCV

### Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/video_captioning_vlm.git
cd video_captioning_vlm

# Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure your data includes videos and their corresponding captions. Place these files in the data/ directory.
# The data should be in a CSV file with three columns: video_path, input_text, and target_caption.

# To fine-tune the Vision-Language model for video captioning, run the following command:
python scripts/train.py --data_path data/video_captioning_data.csv

# To evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned model, run:
python scripts/evaluate.py --model_path models/ --data_path data/video_captioning_data.csv
